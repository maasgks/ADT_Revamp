/* ══ CONTRACT TYPES: ONE CONFIG, FOUR TYPES, NO FORKED LISTING ═══════════════
   The contracts listing used to know exactly one thing about a contract's
   type: how to print it into a <td>. Everything else - the status vocabulary,
   the stage list behind the Action menu, the column headers, the summary
   cards - was written once, inline, for EOR, and PEO inherited it by accident
   rather than by decision.

   Adding Immigration and Contractor that way would have meant a second copy of
   buildContractsListingHTML with different strings in it, and then a third. So
   the per-type differences live HERE, as data, and the listing reads them. One
   table renderer, one filter bar, one Action menu, four types.

   TO ADD A FIFTH TYPE: add an entry to CT_TYPES and a flow to CT_FLOWS. If you
   find yourself editing pages.js to do it, this file has failed. */

const CT_TYPE_ALL='ALL';

/* ── Stage flows ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Eight stages each, deliberately. --st-p1..p8 in main.css is an eight-step
   colour ladder where the shade IS the data (how far along a deal is), and it
   is documented there as clearing dE 12 pairwise. Eight stages per type means
   every type reads on that same ladder, so a half-finished Immigration case is
   the same colour as a half-finished EOR placement. A ninth stage would need a
   ninth colour that provably differs from the other eight, and there isn't one
   going spare.

   EOR and PEO share a flow. The PRD writes them as "EOR/PEO" throughout and
   never gives PEO a distinct status, event or gate - so PEO is a peer type in
   the picker (its own intake form, its own party of record) that runs the EOR
   lifecycle. The moment PEO grows a stage EOR doesn't have, give it its own
   list here; nothing else has to change. */
